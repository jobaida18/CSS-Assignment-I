        <img src="assests/img/Pilatus.jpg" alt="Mount Pilatus">
        <p>Rising from the shore of Lake Lucerne, Pilatus can be reached by both cogwheel railway and tram. The railway,
            built in 1889, is the steepest cogwheel railway in the world with an average gradient of 38% and a maximum
            gradient of 48%. Because Pilatus is the most prominent peak near Lucerne, it has been a popular tourist
            attraction. Notable visitors who have climbed Pilatus include Theodore Roosevelt and Queen Victoria.</p>

        <h2><u>Mont Dolent</u></h2>
        <img src="assests/img/Mont Dolent.jpg" alt="Mont Dolent">
        <p>Located in the Mont Blanc Range, Mont Dolent is distinguished because it lies on the border of three
            countries—Italy, France, and Switzerland. First climbed in 1864 by Edward Whymper and Michel Croz, who then
            made the first ascent of the Matterhorn in the following year.</p>

        <h2><u>Finsteraarhorn</u></h2>
        <img src="assests/img/Finsteraarhorn.jpg" alt="Finsteraarhorn">
        <p>This peak isn’t as visible from the major tourist centers and not as easily recognizable as the neighboring
            Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau, but the Finsteraarhorn is the highest mountain peak in the Bernese Alps. It was
            first climbed in 1829.</p>
